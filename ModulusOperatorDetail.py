print('''
The % (modulo) operator yields the remainder from the division of
the first argument by the second. The numeric arguments are first
 converted to a common type. A zero right argument raises the
ZeroDivisionError exception. The arguments may be floating point
numbers, e.g., 3.14%0.7 equals 0.34
(since 3.14 equals 4*0.7 + 0.34.)
The modulo operator always yields a result with the same sign
as its second operand (or zero); the absolute value of the
result is strictly smaller than the absolute value of the second
operand [2].

 The first number is the numerator and the second is the denominator. In our example
2 divided by 6 is 0 remainder 2, therefore the result is 2.

The modulus is a mathematical operation, sometimes described
as "clock arithmetic." I find that describing it as simply a
remainder is misleading and confusing because it masks the real
reason it is used so much in computer science. It really is used
 to wrap around cycles.

Think of a clock: Suppose you look at a clock in "military" time,
 where the range of times goes from 0:00 - 23.59. Now if you wanted
something to happen every day at midnight, you would want the current
 time mod 24 to be zero:

if (hour % 24 == 0):

You can think of all hours in history wrapping around a circle of
24 hours over and over and the current hour of the day is that
infinitely long number mod 24. It is a much more profound concept
than just a remainder, it is a mathematical way to deal with cycles
and it is very important in computer science. It is also used to
wrap around arrays, allowing you to increase the index and use
the modulus to wrap back to the beginning after you reach the end
 of the array.

Floor Division(//) - The division of operands where the result is the quotient
 in which the digits after the decimal point are removed. But if one of the
 operands is negative, the result is floored, i.e.,
 rounded away from zero (towards negative infinity): examples: 9//2 = 4 and
 9.0//2.0 = 4.0, -11//3 = -4, -11.0//3 = -4.0
Towards infinity and away from zero are different things.
Example for (-1.2 and 3.4): "flooring" is towards
 negative infinity (-2 and 3), "truncating" is towards zero
 (-1 and 3), "saturating" is away from zero (-2 and 4),
 and "ceiling" is towards positive infinity (-1 and 4).
